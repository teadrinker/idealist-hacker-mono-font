Issues
 * Only ASCII characters (fallbacks to [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/))
 * Converted from pixel font, so kind of looks bad in large sizes. I hope to look into that at some point, most of this point is purely geometric and would be nice if that wasn't lost in translation...
 * Some ligatures would also help some cases...
